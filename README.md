# Assignment1-Tiidelab
This is a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 200, with two exceptions.
For numbers divisible by 6, print "Shams" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 8 (and
not 6), print "TIIDELAB" instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print
"ShamsTIIDELAB" for numbers that are divisible by both 6 and 8 (and still print "Shams" or
"TIIDELAB" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of
programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labour market value just went up.)
